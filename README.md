# Rhythm Heaven Silver English Fan translation
The Rhythm Tengoku Silver is a project started in 2008 to translate the exclusive JPN game Rhythm Tengoku in english for making it be playable for everyone, then was stopped in 2012 (and updated in 2017). In this time I decided to continue it.
Feel free to contribute.
